# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Karissa Leslie. I‚Äôm building a career in cybersecurity and IT with a focus on threat detection and system security. I hold a Security+ certification and am actively developing hands-on skills through Hack The Box and TryHackMe. I‚Äôm committed to continuous learning and applying what I learn to help protect digital systems.I have a Bachelor‚Äôs and an Associate‚Äôs degree in Cybersecurity, providing solid knowledge in security principles, network defense, and incident response.


My portfolio showcases a range of projects and practical exercises that demonstrate my skills and knowledge in cybersecurity and IT. You‚Äôll find hands-on labs and challenges completed on platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe, illustrating my abilities in threat detection, penetration testing, and system security. Additionally, the portfolio includes examples of my work with network defense, vulnerability assessments, and incident response simulations. It reflects my ongoing commitment to learning and applying cybersecurity best practices to real-world scenarios.


**Hack The Box and TryHackMe are popular online platforms designed to help people learn and practice cybersecurity skills through hands-on challenges and labs.

**Hack The Box (HTB):**
HTB offers a wide range of real-world simulated environments where users can practice penetration testing, vulnerability analysis, and ethical hacking. It‚Äôs known for its ‚Äúhackable‚Äù machines and challenges that range from beginner to advanced levels, making it a favorite among cybersecurity professionals and learners looking to sharpen their offensive security skills.

**TryHackMe:**
TryHackMe provides guided, beginner-friendly learning paths alongside practical labs covering cybersecurity topics like network security, web application security, and defensive techniques. It‚Äôs great for learners at all levels because it offers step-by-step tutorials and explanations to help build foundational skills and confidence.

Both platforms are excellent for developing hands-on experience, which is essential for careers in cybersecurity.**

**HackerRank:**
Without prior job experience, I use HackerRank to strengthen my programming and logical reasoning skills, which are essential in both IT support and cybersecurity roles.
Solving coding challenges in:

Python, Shell scripting, Regex, and Algorithms

Improving my ability to automate tasks, write secure code, and build foundational logic

Practicing in a structured, measurable way through timed assessments and ranked competitions


üöÄ **Why It Matters**
As someone starting from scratch, platforms like Hack The Box,TryHackMe, and HackerRank allow me to gain experience without a job title. I can demonstrate:

Hands-on technical growth

Commitment to learning

Problem-solving in simulated work scenarios

These platform helps bridge the gap between no professional experience and real-world technical problem solving.
